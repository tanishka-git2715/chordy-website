## Security Note

⚠️ **Important**: The admin dashboard is currently publicly accessible. Anyone can visit `/admin` and see the data.

### To Secure It (Recommended for Production):

1. **Add Password Protection** - I can add a simple password prompt
2. **Use Vercel Authentication** - Integrate with Vercel's auth
3. **Add IP Whitelist** - Only allow specific IPs to access

Would you like me to add password protection to the admin page?
